just like the 1b (didnt want to copy the explenation here but its the same), but this time we are going to replace the last word we put- 0, with 0x42. this will make the exit code to be 0x42 (because of the way we orgenized the stack this will be in the same location as an argument to exit).
meaning, that we are going to retrive: 
*135 bytes of 'a'- this is only for padding* + *system return address in LI* + *exit address* + *the address of \bin\sh* + "exit code- we will choose 0x42"
